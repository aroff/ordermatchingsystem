notes:

The following tactics are used in the architecture:

The disruptor pattern in the event and order queues
Shared memory for the event and order queues
Continuous querying language (CQL) on the ODS
Data filtering with the filter design pattern on incoming data
Congestion avoidance algorithms on all incoming and outbound connections
Active queue management (AQM) and explicit congestion notification
Commodity computing resources with capacity for upgrade (scalable)
Active redundancy for all single points of failure
Indexation and optimized persistence structures in the ODS
Schedule regular data backup and clean-up scripts for ODS
Transaction histories on all databases
Checksums for all orders to detect faults
Annotate events with timestamps to skip 'stale' events
Order validation rules e.g. maximum trade quantities
Automated trader components use an in-memory database for analysis
Two stage authentication for user interfaces connecting to the ATs
Encryption on user interfaces and connections to the ATs
Observer design pattern for the MVC to manage views
